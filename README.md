The use of statistical models in computer algorithms allows computers to make decisions and predictions, and to perform tasks that traditionally require human cognitive abilities. Machine learning is the interdisciplinary field at the intersection of statistics and computer science which develops such statistical models and interweaves them with computer algorithms. It underpins many modern technologies, such as speech recognition, Internet search, bioinformatics and computer vision—Amazon’s recommender system, Google’s driverless car and the most recent imaging systems for cancer diagnosis are all based on Machine Learning technology.

This repository will hold the info about the work I have done in the course and include assignments and courses associated with Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Visualization.
